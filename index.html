				<h4>My name is Ai Kobayashi</h4>

				<p>Hello, Nice to cyber-meet you. Thank you very much for visiting my website.</p>
				<p>My name is Ai Kobayashi. I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan until I was 19. Then, I came to Toronto with NO English skills. Yeah, you read it right. I came here as an ESL student on my own (thought I had to emerge myself into English environment, otherwise I wouldnâ€™t feel the necessity of learning it seriously.) In my original plan, I was going back to Japan at some point but during my stay here, I fell in love with Canada, and decided to stay longer; thus, I enrolled at Seneca College where I graduated with Hospitality Management Diploma with honour.</p>
				<p>After that, I have worked in the hospitality industry and the media industry before settling to my current position in the international education industry. I work with more than 100+ international high school students per academic year. I mentor them throughout their time here to help achieve both of their academic and personal goals. It is such a rewarding role to see them grow and hear their success stories.</p>
				<p>In my personal life, I have two children, a 5 years-old girl and a 1 year-old boy. My passion goes to a lot of things but the biggest is always something crafty: I do cross stitching, sewing, knitting, and more. In 2020, I finally took my courage to open an <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/EasyPeasyNeedleCraft" target="_blank">Etsy shop</a> to display my crafty creations. Most of my free time goes to my kids but I am planing to expand my Etsy shop along with this website as coding is my newest crafty passion. This website was developed by me from scratch with a guidance from my husband who works in IT industry.</p>
